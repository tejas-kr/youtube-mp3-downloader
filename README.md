# YouTube Playlist Downloader 😎

YouTube music does not have a feature to save your queue as a playlist. So, I created a script to download the whole queue and save on you disk.  👍


# Requirements
- **Python** > 3.6.x
- **Pip** > 21.x.x
- **youtube-dl** 2021.6.6 
- **ffmpeg** - included in the root folder

## Install instructions for youtube-dl

    pip install youtube-dl

## How to run the script 

1. Go to the YouTube Video or Playlist
2. Copy the link
3. Run the below command in terminal/command line
 `python main.py "url"`
 **Example - **
 `python main.py "https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=rrZcR4GzWq8&list=RDAMVMNWCG3MUDc0A"`
